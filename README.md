# TTP
Reliable Transport over UDP 

Introduction
In this project, you will be exploring various functions that are offered by a reliable transport layer protocol. 
After successfully completing this lab, you would have built a reliable transport protocol (like TCP). 
Letâ€™s call this protocol Trusted Transport Protocol (TTP). 
TTP will have many of the properties that TCP has, like acknowledgements, re- transmission, segmentation and re-assembly, sliding window mechanisms, etc. 
You will use UDP as the underlying mode of communication between nodes, on top of which you will add some properties that ensure reliability.
